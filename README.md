# Briefyfy: A Smart Summarizer for Bulky Texts

## Brief Overview

Briefyfy is a smart summarizer that utilizes state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) to condense bulky texts into concise summaries. One of its main features is the ability to operate without an internet connection, making it a versatile solution for offline summarization within intranets. Leveraging the power of transformers, it supports AI/ML-based text summarization and specializes in summarizing scientific and technical content. The project emphasizes modularity, scalability, and ease of deployment.
